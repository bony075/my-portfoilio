            <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that
                work.
                That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                Development Hero.

            <p>
                I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my grandma
                how to make simple
                website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

                    the

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them.
                    They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
